/**
 * Every gate that needs a browser, against one server.
 *
 *   npm run verify
 *
 * One `vite preview` on a port the operating system hands out, proved byte for
 * byte against `dist/index.html` before anything measures it, and handed to each
 * gate through `EVALKIT_URL`. `watch-it-think` learned this the expensive way:
 * eleven gates each starting their own server leaked ten of them on the
 * development machine and let one report green against a page it had never
 * started.
 *
 * There is one gate here today and this file still exists, because the reason
 * `check:boundaries` was outside the build is that nothing collected it, and a
 * gate outside the build is a gate somebody has to remember.
